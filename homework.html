    <p>U.S. President Joe Biden has posted a message appreciating the welcome he received in Vietnam <br>and stressing
        that his ongoing state visit to the country is "historic."</p>
    <p>"Thank you for the warm welcome, Vietnam. I know this will be a historic visit," he wrote on X, <br> formerly
        Twitter, on Sunday night.</p>
    <p>In another post later, he published a photo of himself with Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong <br> and
        wrote: "It was great to speak with you, General Secretary. As I said earlier, Vietnam and the United States <br>
        have an enormous opportunity to be critical partners. I know we can achieve the aspiration both countries share
        <br> for a future of greater peace, security, and prosperity."</p>
    <p>The U.S. president arrived in Hanoi on Sunday afternoon for a two-day state visit at the invitation of Trong,<br>
        his first official visit to Vietnam since taking office in early 2021.</p>
    <p>After a welcome ceremony, the two nations' top leaders held a meeting where it was announced that Vietnam-U.S.
        <br>relations were now elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, 10 years after they established a
        Comprehensive Partnership.</p>
    <p>At the meeting the two leaders agreed that the most important factors in the development of Vietnam-U.S. <br>ties
        are full respect for the basic principles that guide their relations, including respect for the United Nations
        Charter, <br> international law and each other's political institutions, independence, sovereignty, and
        territorial integrity.</p>
    <p>Speaking with the press after the meeting, Biden also emphasized the message of this "historic visit."</p>

    <p>He mentioned the progress in Vietnam-U.S. relations, which had gone from conflict to normalization and<br>
        elevation in relations, and reiterated that Vietnam is an important partner for the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific
        region.</p>
    <p>The White House on Sunday said it will enhance cooperation with Vietnam in science and technology, <br>education,
        commerce, investment and economy, energy, climate change response, environment, healthcare, security, <br> war
        legacy remediation and boosting connections between the countries' businesses.</p>
    <p>With this visit, Biden has become the fifth U.S. president to visit Vietnam since the two countries <br>
        normalized relations in 1995.

        Economic cooperation has been a focus in the two countries' relations. Bilateral <br> trade topped US$123.86
        billion in 2022, an 11% increase from 2021.</p>
    <p>The U.S. is Vietnam's largest export market and its second largest commercial partner. Vietnam is the <br>
        seventh largest commercial partner for the U.S.

        U.S. FDI in Vietnam is worth over $11 billion in over 1,200 projects, the 11th highest of any country.</p>
    <p>The two sides have also worked to repatriate the remains of 733 U.S. soldiers who died during the war.</p>
